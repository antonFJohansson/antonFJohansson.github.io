          <h2><strong>Why make a memory game?</strong></h2>
         <div class="contentText">

             During my spare-time it has been too common
              for me that I mindlessly browse the internet.
               I wanted some different activity which I felt 
               was a bit more stimulating but still different 
               from my usual working activities such that my
                mind could relax properly. Playing memory games 
                filled this void for a bit but I quickly grew 
                tired of the ads that were present in every memory
                 game that I could find. Thus I just wanted to create 
                 simple ad-free memory game myself which I could use.
                  The game has two modes, remembering words and remembering 
                  patterns (since these are the ones I enjoy the most). 
                  If this is also interesting to you then please check it out. 
                  The game can be found 
                  <a href="memorygame/memory-game.html">here</a>
                  and the code can as usual be found on <a href="https://github.com/antonFJohansson/memory-game-js/tree/main">github</a>.
