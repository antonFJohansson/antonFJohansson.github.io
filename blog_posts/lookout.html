          <div id="contentTitle">Lookout: A Method to Interpret Outliers</div>
          <div class="contentText">
           
           I recently co-supervised a master's project at Volvo which aimed to create a <i>Data Cleaning Tool</i> 
           (the tool can be found <a href="https://github.com/devosmitachatterjee2018/DataCleaningTool">here</a>).
           Given that the data we encounter in practice often contains errors such as misspellings, 
           inconsistent classes, infeasible values etc, there is a need for tools that provide easy and
            intuitive ways to clean the data.
            <br>
            <br>
          While detecting and fixing, e.g, misspellings can be relatively easy, not all errors
           are as easily fixed. One such error is outliers. The issue with outliers is that
            it might not always be clear if these outliers represent some aspect of the data
             which we have not considered (a patient with a relatively normal weight but with
              an abnormal blood pressure could indicate that this patient is suffering from a
               hidden disease), or if they are complete noise and should be disregarded (measurements 
               which are nonsense due to electrical failures in the measurement devices). Thus detecting 
               outliers and removing them is not always the optimal solution to data cleaning,
                we also need to understand why a given data point was classified as an outlier. 
                Otherwise we might remove parts of the data that can be important for our end-goal.
                <br>
                <br>
                
          While there exists a few different methods for explaining outliers (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02617">[1]</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6729536">[2]</a>, <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2018/0341.pdf">[3]</a>),
           the one that seemed especially interesting was <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lakoglu/odd/accepted_papers/ODD_v50_paper_24.pdf"><i>LookOut</i></a>.
           Some benefits with LookOut are: 
            <ul>
                <li>It is method agnostic, i.e, we can still use our favorite outlier detecting method and still obtain explanations.</li>
                <li>It explains outliers in terms of the original features which makes it easily interpretable.</li>
                <li>It is easy to implement (My implementation can be found on <a href="https://github.com/antonFJohansson/LookOut-for-Pictorial-Explanation">github</a>).</li>
            </ul>
          So how does it work?
       </div>
          <h2><strong>LookOut</strong></h2>
          <div class="contentText">
          LookOut bases its method on the fact that 2-dimensional plots are interpretable 
          and that an analyst has limited attention. For some analysts, a data set with 
          10 features might be considered low-dimensional. But just having 10 features gives
           45 2-dimensional plots that can be created from all the different feature pairs.
            For an analyst to try and stare through 45 plots to detect and understand outliers
             is quite an effort. LookOut instead proposes that we should work with a
              <i>plot budget</i>, i.e, we should only display a few number of plots 
              which the analyst can easily study. Given a set of outliers in the data,
               these plots are chosen by finding the feature pairs that maximize the 
               outlier score for the outliers. In addition, in order to make it easy 
               for the analyst to explain a given outlier, each outlier is only
                explained through a single plot so that there are not multiple
                 explanations for why it is deemed an outlier.
                 <br>
                 <br>
          Mathematically we can formulate this as an optimization problem.
           If we have a set of outliers \(\mathcal{A}\) we seek to explain,
            then given that the plot budget is denoted by \(b\), the set of all possible
             feature pair plots as \(\mathcal{P}\), the set of feature-pair
              plots to display as \(S\) and the outlier score for outlier \(i\) when we
               only consider the feature-pair \(j\) as \(s_{i,j}\), we can formulate the optimization problem as
          $$\max_{S \subset \mathcal{P}, |S| = b} f(S) = \sum_{a_i \in \mathcal{A}} \max_{p_j \in S} s_{i,j}.$$
          While obtaining the optimal solution is NP-hard, \(f(S)\) can be shown to be sub-modular,
           non-negative and non-decreasing. These functions allow for efficient
            greedy optimization routines where we have a guarantee of obtaining a no worse solution
             than that of 63% of the optimal one. Thus by using a greedy scheme, we can obtain an approximate solution as follows
             <ol>
                 <li>Fit an outlier detection method to all possible feature pairs.</li>
                 <li>For i=1:b</li>
                 <ol>
                      <li>Add the feature-pair \(p \in \mathcal{P}\) that maximizes the marginal gain</li>
                      $$f(S \cup \{p\}) - f(S)$$
                      <li>Remove the added feature pair \(p\) from \(\mathcal{P}\).</li>
                 </ol>
             </ol>
          The approximate solution can then be displayed to the analyst which allows
           them to reason and argue regarding why an outlier was deemed an outlier.
       </div>
           <h2><strong>Results</strong></h2>
          <div class="contentText">
          While the authors convincingly demonstrate the method 
          on some examples in the article, I wanted to try it on some
           other data sets to get a feel for the method on my own. I chose
            to try it on the classical Fisher Iris data set, a Forest Fire
             data set and a Bike Sharing data set. The results are as follows
           </div>
             <h2><strong>Iris data</strong></h2>
             <div class="contentText">
          Iris data is a classical machine learning data set of the length and
           width measurements of the sepals and petals of three different kinds
            of Iris flowers. By running LookOut and choosing the plot budget to
             2, the 5 most extreme outliers can be explained as follows (outliers are marked in orange):
             <img src="../img/blogImgs/lookout/iris_img.PNG" alt="Results on Iris data set" class="responsiveImg">
             
          We see that the outliers are (not surprisingly) explained by unusually
           extreme measurements for the two selected features.
       </div>
           <h2><strong>Forest Fires data</strong></h2>
           <div class="contentText">
          This <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires">data set</a> consists of measurements related to forest fires in northern Portugal.
           The features consist of information related to position,
            weather and moisture conditions in the forests.
             The features that we will need to understand for the ensuing plots are
             <ol>
                 <li>rain: outside rain in mm/m2</li>
                 <li>FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system (a measure of moisture in forest litter)</li>
                 <li>wind: wind speed in km/h</li>
                 <li>Y: y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map</li>
                 <li>temp: temperature in Celsius degrees</li>
             </ol>
          
          By running LookOut and choosing the plot budget to 3,
           the 8 most extreme outliers can be explained as follows (outliers are marked in orange)
           <img src="../img/blogImgs/lookout/fire_img.PNG" alt="Results on Forest Fires data set" class="responsiveImg">
           
          From the plots we might be able to deduce that
          <ol>
              <li>Observation 499 was deemed an outlier because of the unusual rain amount that fell during that forest fire.</li>
              <li>Observation 65 and 75 were deemed outliers due to the unusual low temperatures in those regions of the parks.</li>
          </ol>
          
          We can also obtain explanations for the other outliers but these might not be as clear.
       </div>
          <h2><strong>Bike sharing data</strong></h2>
          <div class="contentText">
          This <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset">data set</a> consists of information related to a bike rental
           during the period 2011- 2012. The features are related to information
            for each specific day such as weather, holiday, temperature, time of year etc.
          The features that we will need to understand for the ensuing plots are
          <ol>
              <li>weathersit: Scale 1 - 4 with 1 being few clouds and 4 being heavy rain.</li>
              <li>holiday: Binary, whether it is holiday or not.</li>
              <li>yr: Binary, 0 for 2011, 1 for 2012.</li>
              <li>atemp: Normalized temperature in Celcius (the description says feeling temperature which I interpret as the experienced temperature).</li>
              <li>windspeed: Normalized wind speed.</li>
          </ol>
          
          By running LookOut and choosing the plot budget to 3,
           the 8 most extreme outliers can be explained as follows (outliers are once again marked in orange):
           <img src="../img/blogImgs/lookout/bicycle_img.PNG" alt="Results on Bike Sharing data set" class="responsiveImg">
           
          We can see that the interpretations are not as clear as for the other two cases.
           Or while we can interpret point 368 as being an outlier due to it being a
            holiday with good weather, it is not clear why not the other similar
             days as this one were regarded as outliers. This is an issue when
              using the method on naively on datasets with multiple categorical
               attributes. Data points 307 can be seen to be an outlier due
                to the fact that that day had an abnormally high windspeed 
                with a low experienced temperature.
               </div>
                <h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
                <div class="contentText">
          Being able to reason and argue for why an observation is deemed an outlier
           is an important step on the path to understanding our data sets.
            LookOut provides a method to interpret outliers by finding which 
            feature pairs that can provide the best explanation for why the
             observations were deemed as abnormal. While the obtained 
             explanations can be difficult to interpret for some 
             data sets, it can provide meaningful explanations in many other cases.
             Ultimately, it is a method that I will consider using in my future data analysis.
