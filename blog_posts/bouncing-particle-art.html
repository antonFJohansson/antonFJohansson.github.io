             <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
             <div class="contentText">
              I recently gained some interested in generative art
               and wanted to try creating something myself. I like 
               geometric patterns and wanted to create something 
               along those lines. An interesting geometric
                pattern which is not too overly complicated is that 
                which arises from particles bouncing around inside a circle.
              I programmed this and the result you can see below. 
              An explanation of the process can be found further down. The code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/antonFJohansson/simpleGeometricCircleArt">github</a>.

              Number of particles in outer circle: <input id="inp1" type="number" min="1" max="10" value="1" style="width:3em;"/><br>
              Number of particles in inner circle: <input id="inp2" type="number" min="1" max="10" value="1" style="width:3em;"/><br>
              Particle speed: <input id="inp3" type="number" min="1" max="25" value="10" style="width:3em;"/><br>
              Line thickness: <input id="inp4" type="number" min="1" max="10" value="10" style="width:3em;"/><br>

          <h2><strong>How it works</strong></h2>
          <div class="contentText">
          The entire art piece is generated by generating random particles in a circle 
          with a given velocity and 
          simply following the particles as they bounce around. Two questions which might be of interest are how 
          to prevent the particles in the outer circle from going into the smaller circle and how to actually reflect the particles 
          when they encounter the boundary. 
          <br>
          <br>
          In order to prevent the outer particles from going inside the inner circle we 
          just need to ensure that the 
          velocity vector that they are initialized with bounces them around
           the outer part. This can be done by calculating the tangent 
          vector to the inner circle and using that as the direction for the velocity.
          Given that we want the tangent at the point \((\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))\), we can 
          obtain the tangent vector by finding the vector \((v_x,v_y)\) that satisfies 
          $$\cos(\theta)v_x + \sin(\theta)v_y = 0$$
          Solving this and obtaining \(v = (v_x,v_y)\) will yield a particle trajectory that never 
          intersects the inner circle as long as the particle is initialized along the vector intersecting
          the circle center and the point \((\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))\), see the dotted line in the figure below.

          In this project I also added some small random perturbations to the initialization of the point to get some slight 
          variation in the trajectories, while still ensuring that they do not intersect the inner circle.
          <br>
          Similarly, we can obtain the reflection angle \(\theta\) by calculating the inner product between the velocity vector 
          and the normal vector of the circle (the vector pointing towards the center of the circle). The new velocity vector 
          is then obtained by a rotation of \(2\theta\). This can be seen below.

          While there are some other aspects to take into consideration, these two are the main ones. If you are interested in the code 
          then it can be found on <a href="https://github.com/antonFJohansson/simpleGeometricCircleArt">github</a>.
