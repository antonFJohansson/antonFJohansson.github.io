In statistics textbooks it is common to encounter exercises as
<br>
<br>
<div style="border-radius: 20px; border-color: rgb(70, 140, 95); border: 5px solid;
padding: 1em;">
Assume we have a scale that gives the true weight of an object + 
an error that is normally distributed with 0 mean and variance 0.1. 
Suppose we weigh the same object 10 times and get the measurements as
<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    x = [4.53, 4.8, 5.14, 5.02, 4.99, 
    4.82, 5.17, 4.69, 5.70, 4.87]
</div>

<ul>
<li>a) Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true weight of the object.</li>
<li>b) Can you say that there is a 95% probability that the true weight lies in the interval from a)?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>
While exercise a) can be solved quickly as
<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span>mean(x) \(\pm\) z<sub>0.025</sub>\(\sqrt{\sigma^2/n}\) = (4.79, 5.18)</span>
</div>
<br>
 it seems many students can have some difficulty with question b.
It seems the most common misinterpretation for b) is 
"Yes. There is a 95% probability that the true weight lies in this interval". 

Of course teachers try to say that this is incorrect
 and that one should not interpret confidence intervals like that,
  but I have often found that the teachers do not give a proper 
  explanation (or at least not an explanation suited for the students' level)
   of why it is wrong. This leaves the students wondering why their 
   interpretation was incorrect. I thus wanted to try and give an
    intuitive demonstration of why it is an incorrect interpretation 
    and also how we should interpret it.


    <h2><strong>Reformulation of the problem</strong></h2>


Imagine that there is a machine that will give you a scratch card
 with a 10,000$ win with 95% probability (a most generous machine) 
 each time you press a button and with 5% probability you get nothing.
  So we go to the machine, we press the button, get a scratch card and scratch
   it to see if we get 10,000$ or not. Now imagine that when we scratch away the
    covering we find that we did not win. If we at this point stand up and exclaim
     "There is a 95% probability that I will win 10,000$ with <b>this</b> scratch card!" 
     it might seem a bit strange. If the strangeness is not clear to you, 
     let us delve deeper into why this can seem strange. 
First of all, we know that the scratch card we bought does not contain any prize.
 We know this because probably on the scratch card it says something like "You lost".
  So there is no way at all for us to win with <b>this</b> card. If there still was a 95% probability 
  of winning with <b>this</b> scratch card that means that somehow our card could magically switch the text
   "You lost" to "You won".
   Of course this is not possible.
<br>
<br>
When we speak of probabilities then there needs to be some random element involved.
 In our case, the machine contains the random element since a different card might
  come out each time we press the button. But when we are speaking of a single card
   that we have obtained from the machine then there is no longer any probability
    associated with <b>this specific</b> card. I have tried to emphasize this 
    above by making the text bold when we refer to the specific card that we obtained.
     This card is either a winning or a losing card. We can only formulate probabilities
      if we include the machine (either explicitly or implicitly) in our question.
       We can only say that we have a 95% chance of obtaining a winning scratch card when we
        press the button on the machine.
<br>
<br>
Now if we return to confidence intervals then we are in a very similar 
situation as above with the scratch cards. We cannot say that <b>this specific</b> confidence interval
 (in our case above, the interval (4.79, 5.18))
 contains the true weight with 95% probability. 
 The interval either contains the true weight of the object or not, it cannot magically
  change once it has been determined. The machine in this case is the repeated measurements
   of the object, this is where the randomness lies. Thus we can only say that we have a 95% chance 
   of creating a 95% confidence interval that contains the true weight when we weigh the
    object. Thus we must repeat the measurements, create new confidence intervals and only by doing
     this can we start to think in terms of probabilities. I think that an issue with teaching this
      is that for most exercises then one does not get to collect the data oneself/weight the object.
       One is simply handed some observed data points and asked to calculate the confidence interval.
        Therefore it can be easy to misunderstand and think that the probability is associated 
        with the interval you calculated, you do not get to see any other confidence intervals after
         all. I think this disconnection might contribute to some of the misunderstandings.
<br>
<br>
Thus I wanted to modify the exercise at the top to try and illustrate
 how it could look like if we were also allowed to collect the data/weigh the object ourselves.
Now luckily for you, I have set up a scale in my apartment 
with the exact properties of those given in exercise at the beginning which 
you can remote control with a button below. The object in my apartment weighs 4kg 
and each time you press the button then a small electric shock will be given to my assistant
 (do not worry, he finds it rather delightful) and he will subsequently weigh the object 10 times 
 and provide the values to you, all to help facilitate your learning.
<br>
<br>
You can find the modified exercise with the button below. 
Each time you press the button ("Perform new weight measurements") you can see that the answer to a) 
changes since each new experiment gives rise to different values.
 Since the true weight of the object is 4kg we expect that in 95% of the times
  we press the button our confidence interval will contain the value 4. The confidence interval will be 
  marked as green if it contains the true weight of 4kg and otherwise it will be red. You can also modify
   the confidence level by drawing on the slider below. If you change the confidence level
    then you will either make it more likely that your interval contains 4 or more unlikely.
     So let's try it out!
     <br>
     <br>
     <div style="border-radius: 20px; border-color: rgb(70, 140, 95); border: 5px solid;
     padding: 1em;">
     Assume we have a scale that gives the true weight of an object + 
     an error that is normally distributed with 0 mean and variance 0.1. 
     Suppose we weigh the same object 10 times and get the measurements as
     <br>
     <br>
     <div style="text-align: center;">
         x = [<span id="dataNew">4.53, 4.8, 5.14, 5.02, 4.99, 
         4.82, 5.17, 4.69, 5.70, 4.87</span>]
     </div>
     
     <ul>
     <li>a) Calculate a <span class="sliderConfLevel">95%</span> confidence interval for the weight of the object.</li>
     <li>Solution a): mean(x) \( \pm \) z<sub id="subText">0.025</sub> \( \cdot \)0.1 = <span class="confNew"> (4.79, 5.18)</span> </li>
     </ul>
     </div>
     <div style="text-align: center;">
     Confidence level: <input style="width: 60%;" id="confSlider" type="range" min="1" max="99" value="95" oninput="calcConfInt()">
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
     <button onclick="changeDataWeights()">Perform new weight measurements</button>
    </div>
     <br>
Now we can connect it back to the scratch card. 
Each time you press the button "Perform new weight measurements" you have a certain probability
of ending up with measurements that give a confidence interval that contains the 
true weight of the object that we are measuring (since the slider is currently at <span class="sliderConfLevel">95%</span>, you
have <span class="sliderConfLevel">95%</span> chance). This is exactly like when we had a certain chance of obtaining
a winning scratch card when pressing the button of the scratch card machine. 
But if you stop pressing the button and only look at the single fixed interval
 that you obtained (in your case <span class="confNew"> (4.79, 5.18)</span>), then we cannot speak of any probability that 
 <b>this specific</b> interval contains the true weight since it is completely fixed. 
 Either the interval contains the value 4 <span id="corrText">(for your interval this is the case)</span> or it does not.
 Thus when dealing with confidence intervals we cannot forget about the process that generated our data.
 This is a crucial aspect in order to obtain a correct interpretation.

<h2><strong>End notes</strong></h2>

Hopefully this exercise made it a bit more clear to you how to interpret confidence intervals.
 If it is still not clear then I suggest that you either read it again or find some other
  source that also tries to explain how to correctly interpret the confidence interval.
   I have found that the best way to learn something is to read about it over and over 
   again and also check for different explanations. We all have different ways of processing
    information and seeing how others think can help us strengthen our own understanding.
